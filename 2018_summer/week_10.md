The last issue I have been working on is securing the controller using the Yacs-auth library. I began by requiring that a session variable called token is present in order to allow access into the controller by using a before action. I am still working with Ada trying to finish up the issue. I learned a huge amount this summer working in RCOS, and it was my first time working on a project on this scale. Hopefully I can continue it next semester!
